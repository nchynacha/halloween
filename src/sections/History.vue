            <p class=" text-sm md:text-lg">Halloween's origins trace back over 2,000 years to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced
                sow-in).
                Celts, who lived mainly in the area that is now Ireland, the UK, and Northern France, believed that on
                the night
                before the new year, the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead became blurred.

                They celebrated Samhain on October 31st, believing the ghosts of the dead returned to Earth. People
                would light
                huge bonfires, offer sacrifices, and wear costumes—typically consisting of animal heads and skins—to
                ward off
                these spirits. The tradition of dressing up and trick-or-treating is a modern evolution of these ancient
                rituals.</p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-sm md:text-lg">
                As Christianity spread, Samhain merged with All Saints' Day (November 1st) and All Souls' Day (November
                2nd),
                creating "All Hallows' Eve," later shortened to Halloween. Irish immigrants brought the festival to
                America in the
                19th century, where it evolved into a community celebration with costumes, parties, and
                trick-or-treating.

            <p class="mt-4 text-sm md:text-lg">
                The iconic Jack-o'-lantern comes from the Irish legend of "Stingy Jack," a man cursed to wander with a
                carved turnip
                lantern. In America, pumpkins replaced turnips due to their abundance. Orange and black, the colors of
                Halloween,
                symbolize autumn harvests and death, respectively. Today, Halloween is a global phenomenon, from
                Mexico's vibrant
                Día de los Muertos to Japan's costume parades in Shibuya.
